This calculator allows for updating
(adding only, removing a grade is easily done by going into the txt file and removing it)

When calculating the full grade, it shows two representations:
    - One where it shows only collected points, meant to incentivize better performance
    - One where it compares collected points to possible collected points

Run terminal_interface.py to run the program
